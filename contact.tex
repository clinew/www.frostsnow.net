% E-mail
\subsection{E-mail}
The most accessible way to contact me is at my e-mail address.

% IRC
\subsection{IRC}
The better way to contact me is via Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  You can find me on the Freenode network under the name \texttt{frostsnow}.

If you know me personally then you might be allowed to connect to my private IRC network.  See \htmladdnormallink{this}{irc.pdf} for details.

% Sponsored media
\subsection{Sponsored Media}
So-called "Social Media" platforms curate their feeds through opaque algorithms which are in large part determined by their sponsors; in other words, what you see is determined by the advertisers, not you.  Hence, the \emph{sponsors} control the media.  It is a sad irony that advertisement-driven networking is called "social".

I deleted my Sponsored Media accounts.  I will not have my information flow be obstructed by anyone, especially not those whose prupose is psychological manipulation.
