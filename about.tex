% The website
\subsection{This Site}
In the early days of cyberspace it was hoped that it would be a world "\ldots where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity."\htmladdnormallink{1}{https://w2.eff.org/Censorship/Internet\_censorship\_bills/barlow\_0296.declaration}  That dream is dead --- cyberspace has emerged as something far more complex than a free speech utopia.  While many personal websites of the 90's were written for self-expression, modern websites are often written with the goal of prostituting ourselves towards our plutocratic overlords.

This website is a throwback to those earlier days.  It is a personal website.  Its content includes technology, video games, and philosophy.  It is not guaranteed to be "age-appropriate".  Hopefully it proves itself to be mildly interesting.

\subsection{\emph{www.}frostsnow.net}
This website is located at "\emph{www.}frostsnow.net", not just "frostsnow.net".  They are different servers, and host different services.  If you believe that the entire Internet is or should be HTTP, then you are wrong --- there are many protocols with various strengths and weakness which make up the Internet, of which HTTP is only one.
