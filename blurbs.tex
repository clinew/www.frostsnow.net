Thoughts that are not worth their own blog.

In a marvelous bit of \htmladdnormallink{Security Theater}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater}, Google Voice prevented me from signing in while in a different town, then, upon returning to my usual town, signing in, then telling Google that "Yes, this was me", tells me that, "For your security, we'll continue to show this alert in your Recent security events page." which means that, should someone else \emph{actually} try signing into my account I will not notice because I will assume that the warning is referring to the previous attempt which I have already marked as valid.  Can I disable this garbage, please?

Managed to fix my XTerm display after the Gentoo \texttt{CHOST} change; the \texttt{.Xresources} file now doesn't like \\
    \texttt{XTerm*background: black} \\
    \texttt{XTerm*foreground: white} \\
\ldots but does accept: \\
    \texttt{xterm*background: black} \\
    \texttt{xterm*background: white} \\
Go figure.

Noting: Google Voice requires \texttt{media.peerconnection.enabled} to be \texttt{true} in order to display data; likewise, Nextdoor requires \texttt{network.http.sendRefererHeader} to be greater than \texttt{0} in order to log in.

Poem I wrote during a recent fever:
\begin{center}
\begin{verse}
{\large\textbf{The Googlaug}} \\
Through me you pass into the Chamber of Echos, \\
Through me you pass into eternal surveillance, \\
Through me among consumers in debt for aye. \\
Boole the fab of my circuit exec'd, \\
To bootstrap me were the threads of Free Software, \\
Open Source, and Hacker Culture. \\
Before me things centralized were none, save things \\
In meatspace, and in meatspace I endure. \\
Free Will abandon, ye who SYN here.
\end{verse}
\end{center}
