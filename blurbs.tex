Fake News is real.

Below are my brief notes on Gentoo auto-login with SSDM; it should be more secure than running \texttt{xorg-server} with the \texttt{suid} flag.  Create file \texttt{/etc/sddm.conf.d/autologin.conf} with contents:
\begin{verbatim}
[Autologin]
User=myuser
Session=i3.desktop
\end{verbatim}
In file \texttt{/etc/conf.d/xdm}, set the following line:
\begin{verbatim}
DISPLAYMANAGER="sddm"
\end{verbatim}
Then be sure to add \texttt{xdm} to the default runlevel with \texttt{rc-update add xdm default}.

Got this error when trying to mount my BeagleBone Black's boot partition:
\begin{verbatim}
[883063.268285] FAT-fs (mmcblk0p1): IO charset ascii not found
\end{verbatim}
Turns out the proper kernel module was compressed for some reason and wouldn't load:
\begin{verbatim}
dante /lib/modules # insmod 4.14.71/kernel/fs/nls/nls_ascii.ko.xz
insmod: ERROR: could not insert module 4.14.71/kernel/fs/nls/nls_ascii.ko.xz: Invalid module format
\end{verbatim}
Easy enough to fix: decompress and re-run \texttt{insmod}:
\begin{verbatim}
xz -d 4.14.71/kernel/fs/nls/nls_ascii.ko.xz
\end{verbatim}
Seems to me rather weird to install a module in a format that can't readily be used, though.

A writer for ``The Atlantic'' \htmladdnormallink{appears to have mistaken}{https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/ice-contract-github-sparks-developer-protests/604339/} a subset of naive progressives within the Open Source community for the Open Source community itself.  There is no ``existential question'' about the nature of Open Source, but there is a question about the judgemental capabilities of those who joined the Open Source bandwagon without actually comprehending what \htmladdnormallink{freedom \#0}{https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html} meant.  Their bubble having been popped, they are now upset at what they \emph{thought} Open Source was and are acting like it's a revelation to anyone but themselves.

\verb|emerge-webrsync: warning: FEATURES=webrsync-gpg is deprecated, see the make.conf(5) man page.|  Hrmph.  After a bit of searching, I found that the global \texttt{FEATURES} flag in \texttt{/etc/make.conf} was migrated to a per-repo setting in \verb|/etc/portage/repos.conf/${NAME}.conf|.  At first I tried using regular \texttt{rsync} by both setting \texttt{sync-type = rsync} and \texttt{sync-rsync-verify-metamanifest = yes} then installing \texttt{app-crypt/openpgp-keys-gentoo-release} and \texttt{app-portage/gemato}, but the cryptographic verification was extremely slow so I moved back to \texttt{webrsync} by setting \texttt{sync-type = webrsync} and \texttt{sync-webrsync-verify-signature = true} instead.

I'm not sure what caused this, and recompiling \texttt{ghostscript-gpl} threw a similar linking error (which I forgot to record), but I managed to "fix" it via:
\begin{verbatim}

I'm\ldots going to hope the problem just stays away now.

I had an issue where audio stopped working on my Novena.  Looking via '\texttt{alsamixer}' showed that it appeared to be using '\texttt{DW-HDMI}' instead of \texttt{imx-audio-es8328}'.  I was able to get it working again by creating '\texttt{/etc/asound.conf}' with contents:

I ran into an issue after a system upgrade (Gentoo) last night where X wouldn't start after the upgrade.  The error was: \texttt{(EE) parse_vt_settings: Cannot open /dev/tty0 (Permission denied)}.  It looks like in moving \texttt{x11-base/xorg-server} from version \texttt{1.19.5-r2} to \texttt{1.20.3}  the \texttt{suid} USE flag was disabled; enabling it fixed the issue for me.

Looks like \texttt{stunnel} 5.43 (or perhaps some slightly earlier version) now only binds to the loopback interface by default; as a result I had to change \texttt{accept = 874} to \texttt{accept = 0.0.0.0:874}.

\subsection{2018-10-05}
In a marvelous bit of \htmladdnormallink{Security Theater}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater}, Google Voice prevented me from signing in while in a different town, then, upon returning to my usual town, signing in, then telling Google that "Yes, this was me", tells me that, "For your security, we'll continue to show this alert in your Recent security events page." which means that, should someone else \emph{actually} try signing into my account I will not notice because I will assume that the warning is referring to the previous attempt which I have already marked as valid.  Can I disable this garbage, please?

\subsection{2018-10-01}

\ldots but does accept: \\
    \texttt{xterm*background: black} \\
    \texttt{xterm*background: white} \\
Go figure.

Poem I wrote during a recent fever:
\begin{center}
\begin{verse}
{\large\textbf{The Googlaug}} \\
Through me you pass into the Chamber of Echos, \\
Through me you pass into eternal surveillance, \\
Through me among consumers in debt for aye. \\
Boole the fab of my circuit exec'd, \\
To bootstrap me were the threads of Free Software, \\
Open Source, and Hacker Culture. \\
Before me things centralized were none, save things \\
In meatspace, and in meatspace I endure. \\
Free Will abandon, ye who SYN here.
