Thoughts that are not worth their own blog.

If programs are written by programmers it follows that applications are written by applicationers.

After some digging, this appears to be caused by: \htmladdnormallink{https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/12/25/211}{https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/12/25/211}.  So much for breaking my woeful kernel upgrade streak.

I had an issue where audio stopped working on my Novena.  Looking via '\texttt{alsamixer}' showed that it appeared to be using '\texttt{DW-HDMI}' instead of \texttt{imx-audio-es8328}'.  I was able to get it working again by creating '\texttt{/etc/asound.conf}' with contents:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
pcm.!default {
	type hw
	card 1
}
ctl.!default {
	type hw
	card 1
}
\end{verbatim}

In order to clone from an HTTPS site which uses self-signed certificates, use '\texttt{GIT_SSL_CAINFO="/path/to/selfsigned/cert.pem" git clone blah blah}'.

\subsection{2018-11-03}
I ran into an issue after a system upgrade (Gentoo) last night where X wouldn't start after the upgrade.  The error was: \texttt{(EE) parse_vt_settings: Cannot open /dev/tty0 (Permission denied)}.  It looks like in moving \texttt{x11-base/xorg-server} from version \texttt{1.19.5-r2} to \texttt{1.20.3}  the \texttt{suid} USE flag was disabled; enabling it fixed the issue for me.

Noting: In order to upgrade LibreCMC, run \texttt{scp image-sysupgrade.bin root@address:/tmp/} then \texttt{sysupgrade -v image-sysupgrade.bin}.

\subsection{2018-10-20}
Looks like \texttt{stunnel} 5.43 (or perhaps some slightly earlier version) now only binds to the loopback interface by default; as a result I had to change \texttt{accept = 874} to \texttt{accept = 0.0.0.0:874}.

\subsection{2018-10-05}
In a marvelous bit of \htmladdnormallink{Security Theater}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater}, Google Voice prevented me from signing in while in a different town, then, upon returning to my usual town, signing in, then telling Google that "Yes, this was me", tells me that, "For your security, we'll continue to show this alert in your Recent security events page." which means that, should someone else \emph{actually} try signing into my account I will not notice because I will assume that the warning is referring to the previous attempt which I have already marked as valid.  Can I disable this garbage, please?

\subsection{2018-10-01}
Managed to fix my XTerm display after the Gentoo \texttt{CHOST} change; the \texttt{.Xresources} file now doesn't like \\
    \texttt{XTerm*background: black} \\
    \texttt{XTerm*foreground: white} \\
\ldots but does accept: \\
    \texttt{xterm*background: black} \\
    \texttt{xterm*background: white} \\
Go figure.

\subsection{2018-04-14}
Noting: Google Voice requires \texttt{media.peerconnection.enabled} to be \texttt{true} in order to display data; likewise, Nextdoor requires \texttt{network.http.sendRefererHeader} to be greater than \texttt{0} in order to log in.

Poem I wrote during a recent fever:
\begin{center}
\begin{verse}
{\large\textbf{The Googlaug}} \\
Through me you pass into the Chamber of Echos, \\
Through me you pass into eternal surveillance, \\
Through me among consumers in debt for aye. \\
Boole the fab of my circuit exec'd, \\
To bootstrap me were the threads of Free Software, \\
Open Source, and Hacker Culture. \\
Before me things centralized were none, save things \\
In meatspace, and in meatspace I endure. \\
Free Will abandon, ye who SYN here.
\end{verse}
\end{center}
